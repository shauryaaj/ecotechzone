RESOURCES TO BE USED:
<BR>•	SOLAR ENERGY
<BR>Solar power is the conversion of energy from sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), indirectly using concentrated solar power, or a combination. Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and solar tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Photovoltaic cells convert light into an electric current using the photovoltaic effect. Energy needed for this product to function will be obtained using solar power through solar panels.
<BR>•	SOLAR PANEL
<BR>A variety of minerals and resources are used to make solar panels, like:
<BR>•	Monocrystalline silicon.
<BR>•	Epitaxial silicon development.
<BR>•	Polycrystalline silicon.
<BR>•	Ribbon silicon.
<BR>•	Mono-like-multi silicon (MLM)
<BR>•	Cadmium telluride.
<BR>•	Copper indium gallium selenide.
<BR>•	Silicon thin film
<BR>•	Gallium arsenide thin film
<BR>•	COPPER: Used in wires and to join the different components using copper tape.
<BR>•	CHARGING CIRCUIT: 
<BR>1.	Gold
<BR>2.	Lithium
<BR>3.	Aluminium
<BR>4.	Cobalt 
<BR>5.	Copper
<BR>6.	Lead
<BR>7.	Nickel
<BR>8.	Petroleum(in the form of plastic insulators)
<BR>9.	Silver
<BR>10.	Zinc
<BR>11.	Silicon
<BR>12.	Wolframite
<BR>13.	Tetrahedrite
<BR>14.	Arsenopyrite
<BR>15.	Tantalite

<BR>•	BIODEGRADABLE CARDBOARD BOXES
<BR>•	CHARGING CABLE: Made up of copper wires. 
<BR>•	HUMAN RESOURCES: A team of workers will be hired, to assemble, test and pack the product. A team of supervisors would also hired to make sure the work is going on smoothly.  

<BR>POWER
<BR>Energy needed for manufacturing of the product and for running the factory will be obtained through electricity taken from Tata Power Company Limited at Rs. 42795 per month.

<BR>LAND
<BR>Factory (81,000 square feet) will be taken on rent in Dera Bassi, Chandigarh at Rs 2.25 lakh per month.

<BR>CAPITAL
<BR>Rs. 1 crore will be taken on loan at 16.49% per annum from ICICI BANK to start production and for other expenses of the manufacturing plant.

<BR>TRANSPORT
<BR>Courier services will be used to transport the products for both online orders as well as for products to be sold in markets in other city. For products to be sold in the nearby markets, trucks will be used to transport them.

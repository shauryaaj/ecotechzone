HOW WE WILL MAKE OUR PRODUCT ENVIRONMENT FRIENDLY:<BR>
The product we have invented is a solar powered mobile charger. This product will use the energy of the sun (solar energy), instead of electricity to charge our mobile phones. Since solar power is an inexhaustible resource, it will help us take a step towards saving our planet through energy conservation. One phone uses over 7 kilowatts to charge itself per year. Since now almost every person has a mobile phone, we can only imagine the amount of energy used by our phones! <BR>
<BR>The steps we will take to ensure that our product does not harm the environment are:	
<BR>•	The energy required by the product will be derived from the sun, making it eco-friendly and non-polluting.
<BR>•	All wires and other circuitry required will be bought from E-waste sellers. Hence, we will be reusing these components for our product.
<BR>•	The packaging boxes will be made of recycled cardboard, which is eco-friendly and biodegradable. 
<BR>Since now there are innumerous mobile phones on the face of the earth, if the public starts using inventions like this to charge their devices, we can save energy and delay the energy crisis to give our scientists time to develop new and cleaner fuels. Our product is one that is environment-friendly and if it used by the masses, it will benefit us considerably.

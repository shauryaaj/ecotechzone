<CENTER> Process of making our product </CENTER><BR>
Our group has developed a very interesting product, a solar mobile charger!  At first we couldnâ€™t decide on the product, but it hit us!  We all found solar power quite interesting and we thought that almost everyone has a cell phone these days.  Cell phones use a lot of energy to recharge.  So we opted for this ecological mobile charger!  We all thought doing this would be quite difficult but we were successful in making this product.  To do this, we need some copper wires, a solar panel, copper tape, a charging circuit and a charging cable. Then you just need to connect the wires from positive terminal of solar panel to negative terminal of charging circuit and negative terminal of solar panel to positive terminal of charging circuit respectively.  It was a very fun business for all of us.  For math, we also calculated the cost of raw materials needed for the product.  We also fixed the sale price after careful calculation.  For the social sciences, we have documented the raw materials and human resources required for our product.  For English, we wrote a concept note for the product.  We did it for Hindi as well.  For science, we have written a document on the benefits of our product for the environment and the public.  For ICT, we have created a website for our product.  We all thought this project was a wonderful learning experience and we all learned that we have to work as a team and always be responsible.  Thank you!
